Fortunately, my subsequent summer internships at Industrial Research Ltd drastically changed my perspective, setting me on course for a PhD in physics with strong focus on nanoscale materials modelling.\nTo this day I see programming and implementing algorithms as an integral part of my process for breaking down complex problems into more manageable chunks. I relied on it to shed new light on how metal nanoparticles can melt and fill a capillary when not expected to. More recently, implementing an agent-based model of a minimal economy in Python helped me develop a clearer understanding of what drives trade and how a price emerges within a market setting."
