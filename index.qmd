:::{#about-dmitrische}
Welcome to my website! 

I am a computational modeller with PhD in physics and extensive postdoctoral experience in simulation-based research, including methods development. 

Most of my academic work focussed on nanoscale materials modelling; but, after joining a fin-tech startup, my interests broadened to include agent-based modelling of socio-economic systems: markets, emissions trading schemes, and blockchain networks. 

To branch out even more, I intend to pursue a number of data science projects and use this website for (i) blogging about my learnings and (ii) showcasing my (past and current) work. 

Please, feel free to visit my [Blog](blog/index.qmd), explore my [Projects](work/index.qmd), download my [CV](DmitriCV.pdf), or reach out by [e-mail](mailto:dmitri.schebarchov@gmail.com).
