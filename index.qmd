:::{#about-dmitrische}
Welcome to my website! 

I am a computational modeller with PhD in physics and extensive experience in simulation-based research, including methods development, data analysis, and communication. 

My earlier research focused primarily on nanomaterials, but joining a fin-tech startup led me to agent-based modelling of markets and other socio-economic systems. 

Recently, I've decided to pursue a number of data science projects and use this website for (i) blogging about my learnings and (ii) showcasing my (old and current) work. 

Please, feel free to visit my [Blog](blog/index.qmd), explore my [Work](work/index.qmd), or view my [CV](about.qmd).
