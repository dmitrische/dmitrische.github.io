## Computational modelling
I genuinely enjoy using computers to simulate and study complex systems, and it is this enjoyment that has motivated me most so far in my career. I still find it surprising, because I was initially dissuaded from programming as a first-year undergraduate. Fortunately, my subsequent summer internships at Industrial Research Ltd drastically changed my perspective, setting me on course for a PhD in physics with strong focus on nanoscale materials modelling. 

To this day I see programming and implementing algorithms as an integral part of my process for breaking down complex problems into more manageable chunks. I relied on it to shed new light on how metal nanoparticles can [melt](../../portfolio/projects/01_ClusterMelting.qmd) and [fill a capillary](../../portfolio/projects/02_Nanofluidics.qmd) when not expected to. More recently, implementing an [agent-based model of a minimal economy](../../portfolio/index.qmd) in Python helped me develop a clearer understanding of what drives trade and how a price emerges within a market setting.
